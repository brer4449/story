              Storytelling is such an important part of connecting with the
              people we love. These memories are what keeps friends and family
              together, but storytelling is actually really hard. When we tell
              stories we ramble, we get distracted, we forget important pieces,
              we bury the lead. That is where Stories Told comes in! We will
              help turn your stories into a work of art that will make for an
              absolutely tear-jerking gift or a treasured memento.

                  Brendan has enjoyed story telling ever since he was a boy,
                  sitting in his Dad's Ford Escort stuck in LA traffic as his
                  pops would listen to This American Life. Still an avid
                  listener today, Brendan paired with Steven to create fresh
                  take on how stories can be composed. He also enjoys board
                  games, and travel, when he's not developing some new website
                  or app.
